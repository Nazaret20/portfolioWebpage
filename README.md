ðŸ’» This is a project from freeCodeCamp to pass the fifth and final part of the course Responsive Web Design.

It only uses HTML and CSS. This last project contains every part of the entire course. I only have a few doubts with it, freeCodeCamp is cool.

ðŸš€ This helped me to get my last Certification Project of the Responsive Web Design course.
