ðŸ’» This is a project from freeCodeCamp to pass the fifth and final part of the course Responsive Web Design.

It only uses HTML and CSS. I only have a few doubts with this project, freeCodeCamp is cool.

ðŸš€ This helped me to get my last Certification Project of the Responsive Web Design course.
